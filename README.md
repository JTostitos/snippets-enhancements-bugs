## Snippets Studio Enhancements and Bug Tracker Repository

You can use this github repository to request enhancements or report bugs on the [issues page](https://github.com/JTostitos/snippets-enhancements-bugs/issues). I'm the only person developing Snippets Studio so enhancements or bugs will not be made, fixed, or released instantly. Please still report them though so I can work on it as soon as possible 🙂.

### How can you request an enhancement or report a bug?

**Please Note:** The enhancement or bug you want to report may have already been added to the issues page. Please do a search first and please contribute to that existing issue if you have something to add.

To contribute to the issues page, GitHub requires you to create a free account. You can [click here](https://github.com/) to do so. Then, go to the [issues page](https://github.com/JTostitos/snippets-enhancements-bugs/issues), click the "New Issue” button, fill out the form and choose a "label" to add to the issue. **Please** include as much information about the enhancement you are requesting or bug you are reporting as possible. Please also be polite and refrain from using profanity or innuendos when using the issues page and conversing with others. This repository needs to be a safe place to report issues.

**Please** stay *on-topic* to the issue report that you are participating in. Please do not post memes. If you have the same issue or want the same enhancement but have no further information to add, please use the reactions button to do so instead of creating a new comment.
